Hello

My name is Merrick. I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at the University of Melbourne. I'm interested in many topics, but for now I am focused on exploring how language works, and what is going on in the mind when we use language. 

I have just completed a year-long research project focused on the perceptual and social processes underlying referential communication - when speakers refer to an object in the world, and listeners use this reference to find the object. This project was supervised by Dr. Francis Mollica. 

Dr. Mollica and myself are presently following up this project with further experiments, which will be completed early in 2025.

:)
