Hello

My name is Merrick. I am interested in how language works, and what is going on in the mind when we use language. 

I have just completed a year-long research project focused on the perceptual and social processes underlying referential communication - when speakers refer to an object in the world, and listeners use this reference to find the object. This project was supervised by Dr. Francis Mollica. 

Dr. Mollica and myself are presently following up this project with further experiments, likely to be completed early 2025.

:)
