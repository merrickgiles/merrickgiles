Hello

My name is Merrick. I am an honours student in psychological science; I am interested in what is going on in the mind and brain when we use language. 

  My present year-long research project is focused on the cognitive processes underlying referential communication - when speakers refer to an object in the world, and listeners use this reference to find the object. More specifically, I am investigating how visual and auditory perception influences this process. This investigation is both empirical and theoretical.

  This work is being supported by the University of Melbourne, and supervised by Francis Mollica.
