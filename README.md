Hello

My name is Merrick. 

I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at the University of Melbourne supervised primarily by Dr. Frank Mollica, and co-supervised by Prof. Andrew Perfors. Broadly, I investigate how people invent and deploy successful cognitive strategies, and how people flexibly adapt these strategies to achieve their goals under environmental constraints. Importantly, I also investigate how people transmit the most successful strategies socially and pedagogically, driving cumulative cultural evolution.

I also research language production and evolution - how people formulate their thoughts into expressions, and how the patterns of such formulations change over time.

:)
