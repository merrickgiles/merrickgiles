Hello 

I am a phd candidate in cognitive science at the University of Melbourne supervised by Dr. Frank Mollica and Prof. Andrew Perfors. We build probabilistic models of human learning and communication as adapted to cognitive and environmental constraints. We also investigate how learned actions are transmitted to others, driving cultural and linguistic evolution.
