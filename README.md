hello

My name is merrick. 

I am a PhD candidate in cognitive science at the University of Melbourne supervised by Dr. Frank Mollica and Prof. Andrew Perfors. We are using bayesian cognitive modelling, information theory, and empirical methods to investigate how agents learn strategies that are adapted to their environmental constraints, and how they transmit these strategies to others, driving cultural evolution. 

a second strand of my research investigates language production -- how people formulate their thoughts into linguistic expressions.
