Hello

My name is Merrick. I am a student, interested in cognitive science. Currently, I am interested in what is going on in the mind and brain when we use language. 

My present research is focused on the cognitive processes underlying referential communication - when a person refers to an object in the world, and another person listens to their reference and uses it to locate the same object. 

More specifically, I am investigating how perceptual factors like salience influence this process. 

This investigation is both empirical in that we are collecting data from human participants, and theoretical in that we are building computational models of these mental processes. 

This work is being supported by the University of Melbourne, and supervised by Francis Mollica.
